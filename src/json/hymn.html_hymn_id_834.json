Amen.\n\nAll these once were sinners, defiled in his sight,\nNow arrayed in pure garments in praise they unite:\n\nHe maketh the rebel a priest and a king,\nHe hath bought us and taught us this new song to sing:\n\nHow helpless and hopeless we sinners had been,\nIf he never had loved us till cleansed from our sin:\n\nAloud in his praises our voices shall ring,\nSo that others believing, this new song shall sing:",
