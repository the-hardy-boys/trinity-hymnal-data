O blissful promise!\n\nFilling our hearts with rapture divine;\n\nO day of days! hail thine appearing!\n\nThy transcendent glory for ever shall shine.\n\n\nEven so come, precious Lord Jesus;\n\nCreation waits redemption to see;\n\nCaught up in clouds, soon we shall meet thee;\n\nO blessed assurance, for ever with thee!",
