Let not the wicked world\nWith its pow'r defeat thee.\nWatch lest with her pomp unfurled\nShe betray and cheat thee.\nWatch and see\nLest there be\nFaithless friends to charm thee,\nWho but seek to harm thee.\n\nWatch against thyself, my soul,\nLest with grace thou trifle;\nLet not self thy thoughts control\nNor God's mercy stifle.\nPride and sin\nLurk within\nAll thy hopes to scatter;\nHeed not when they flatter.\n\nBut while watching, also pray\nTo the Lord unceasing.\nHe will free thee, be thy stay,\nStrength and faith increasing.\nO Lord, bless\nIn distress\nAnd let nothing swerve me\nFrom the will to serve thee.",
