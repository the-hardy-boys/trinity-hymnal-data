O let the words\nLinger on the trembling chords;\nLet the little while between\nIn their golden light be seen;\nLet us think how heav'n and home\nLie beyond that \"Till he come.\"\n\nWhen the weary ones we love\nEnter on their rest above,\nSeems the earth so poor and vast,\nAll our life joy overcast?\nHush, be ev'ry murmur dumb:\nIt is only till he come.\n\nClouds and conflicts round us press:\nWould we have one sorrow less?\nAll the sharpness of the cross,\nAll that tells the world is loss,\nDeath and darkness, and the tomb,\nOnly whisper \"Till he come.\"\n\nSee, the feast of love is spread,\nDrink the wine, and break the bread:\nSweet memorials, till the Lord\nCall us round his heav'nly board;\nSome from earth, from glory some,\nSevered only till he come.",
