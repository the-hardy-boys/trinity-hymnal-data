Have thine own way!\nThou art the Potter; I am the clay.\nMold me and make me after thy will\nWhile I am waiting, yielded and still.\n\nHave thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!\nSearch me and try me, Master, today!\nWhiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now,\nAs in thy presence humbly I bow.\n\nHave thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!\nWounded and weary, help me, I pray!\nPowerall powersurely is thine!\nTouch me and heal me, Saviour divine!\n\nHave thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!\nHold o'er my being absolute sway!\nFill with thy Spirit till all shall see\nChrist only, always, living in me!",
