Lord, to thee:\nMultitude, which none can number,\nLike the stars in glory stand\nClothed in white apparel, holding\nPalms of vict'ry in their hand.\n\nThey have come from tribulation,\nAnd have washed their robes in blood,\nWashed them in the blood of Jesus;\nTried they were, and firm they stood;\nMocked, imprisoned, stoned, tormented,\nSawn asunder, slain with sword,\nThey have conquered death and Satan\nBy the might of Christ the Lord.\n\nMarching with thy cross their banner,\nThey have triumphed, following\nThee, the Captain of salvation,\nThee, their Saviour and their King;\nGladly, Lord, with thee they suffered;\nGladly, Lord, with thee they died;\nAnd by death to life immortal\nThey were born and glorified.\n\nGod of God, the One-begotten,\nLight of light, Emmanuel,\nIn whose body joined together\nAll the saints for ever dwell;\nPour upon us of thy fullness\nThat we may for evermore\nGod the Father, God the Son, and\nGod the Holy Ghost adore.",
