O blissful promise!\nFilling our hearts with rapture divine;\nO day of days! hail thine appearing!\nThy transcendent glory for ever shall shine.\n\nEven so come, precious Lord Jesus;\nCreation waits redemption to see;\nCaught up in clouds, soon we shall meet thee;\nO blessed assurance, for ever with thee!",
