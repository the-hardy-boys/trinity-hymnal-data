Alleluia!\nGod is King in depth and height.\n\nIn her everlasting station\nEarth is poised, to swerve no more;\nThou hast laid thy throne's foundation\nFrom all time where thought can soar\nAlleluia! Alleluia!\nLord, thou art for evermore.\n\nLord, the waterfloods have lifted,\nOcean floods have lift their roar;\nNow they pause where they have drifted,\nNow they burst upon the shore\nAlleluia! Alleluia!\nFor the ocean's sounding store.\n\nWith all tones of waters blending,\nGlorious is the breaking deep;\nGlorious, beauteous without ending,\nGod who reigns on heaven's high steep.\nAlleluia! Alleluia!\nSongs of ocean never sleep.\n\nLord, the words thy lips are telling\nAre the perfect verity:\nOf thine high eternal dwelling\nHoliness shall inmate be.\nAlleluia! Alleluia!\nPure is all that lives with thee.",
