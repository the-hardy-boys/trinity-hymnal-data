Alleluia!\n\nHymns of praise then let us sing, Alleluia!\nUnto Christ our heav'nly King, Alleluia!\nWho endured the cross and grave, Alleluia!\nSinners to redeem and save. Alleluia!\n\nBut the pains which he endured, Alleluia!\nOur salvation have procured; Alleluia!\nNow above the sky he's King, Alleluia!\nWhere the angels ever sing. Alleluia!\n\nSing we to our God above, Alleluia!\nPraise eternal as his love; Alleluia!\nPraise him, all ye heavenly host, Alleluia!\nFather, Son, and Holy Ghost. Alleluia!",
