These precious words remember\nWhen sorely by thy sins oppressed,\nWhen Satan comes to vex thy spirit,\nWhen troubled conscience sighs for rest;\nWhat reason cannot comprehend,\nGod doth to thee by grace extend.\n\nBy grace! Be this in death my comfort;\nDespite my fears, 'tis well with me.\nI know my sin in all its greatness,\nBut also him who sets me free.\nMy heart to naught but joy gives place\nSince I am saved by grace, by grace.",
