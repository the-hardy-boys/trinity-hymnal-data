  "lyrics": "Christ Jesus lay in death's strong bands,\nFor our offenses given;\nBut now at God's right hand he stands\nAnd brings us life from heaven;\nTherefore let us joyful be\nAnd sing to God right thankfully\nLoud songs of hallelujah. Hallelujah!\n\nIt was a strange and dreadful strife\nWhen life and death contended;\nThe victory remained with life,\nThe reign of death was ended;\nHoly Scripture plainly saith\nThat death is swallowed up by death,\nHis sting is lost for ever. Hallelujah!\n\nHere the true Paschal Lamb we see,\nWhom God so freely gave us;\nHe died on the accursed tree\nSo strong his love!to save us.\nSee, his blood doth mark our door;\nFaith points to it, death passes o'er,\nAnd Satan cannot harm us. Hallelujah!\n\nSo let us keep the festival\nWhereto the Lord invites us;\nChrist is himself the Joy of all,\nThe Sun that warms and lights us.\nBy his grace he doth impart\nEternal sunshine to the heart;\nThe night of sin is ended. Hallelujah!\n\nThen let us feast this joyful day\nOn Christ, the Bread of heaven;\nThe Word of grace hath purged away\nThe old and evil leaven.\nChrist alone our souls will feed,\nHe is our meat and drink indeed;\nFaith lives upon no other. Hallelujah!",
