Fear I cannot know;\n\nAnywhere with Jesus I can safely go;\n\n\nAnywhere with Jesus I need fear no ill,\n\nThough temptations gather round my pathway still;\n\nHe himself was tempted that he might help me;\n\nAnywhere with Jesus I may victor be.\n\n\nAnywhere with Jesus I am not alone;\n\nOther friends may fail me, he is still my own;\n\nThough his hand may lead me over dreary ways,\n\nAnywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.\n\n\nAnywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,\n\nWhen the dark'ning shadows round about me creep;\n\nKnowing I shall waken, never more to roam,\n\nAnywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.",
