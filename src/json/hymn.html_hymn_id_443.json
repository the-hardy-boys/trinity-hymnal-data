It is thy dwelling fair;\n\nIn death's abode? Lo, thou art there.\n\n\nIf I the wings of morning take,\n\nAnd far away my dwelling make,\n\nThe hand that leadeth me is thine,\n\nAnd my support thy power divine.\n\n\nIf deepest darkness cover me,\n\nThe darkness hideth not from thee;\n\nTo thee both night and day are bright,\n\nThe darkness shineth as the light.",
