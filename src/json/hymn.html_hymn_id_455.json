Peace, be still!\"\nThey all shall sweetly obey thy will\n\"Peace, peace, be still!\"\n\nMaster, with anguish in spirit\nI bow in my grief today;\nThe depths of my sad heart are troubled,\nO waken and save, I pray;\nTorrents of sin and of anguish\nSweep o'er my sinking soul!\nAnd I perish! I perish! dear Master;\nO hasten, and take control!\n\nMaster, the terror is over,\nThe elements sweetly rest;\nEarth's sun in the calm lake is mirrored,\nAnd heaven's within my breast.\nLinger, O blessed Redeemer,\nLeave me alone no more;\nAnd with joy I shall make the blest harbor,\nAnd rest on the blissful shore.",
