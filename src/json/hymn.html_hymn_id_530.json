O how love I thy law!\n\nIt is my meditation all the day.\n\nO how love I thy law! O how love I thy law!\n\nIt is my meditation all the day.\n\n\nThe precepts of the Lord are right;\n\nWith joy they fill the heart;\n\nThe Lord's commandments all are pure,\n\nAnd clearest light impart.\n\n\nThe fear of God is undefiled\n\nAnd ever shall endure;\n\nThe statutes of the Lord are truth\n\nAnd righteousness most pure.\n\n\nThey warn from ways of wickedness\n\nDispleasing to the Lord,\n\nAnd in the keeping of his Word\n\nThere is a great reward.",
