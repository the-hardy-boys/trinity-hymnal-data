'tis a charming sound,\nHarmonious to mine ear;\nHeav'n with the echo shall resound,\nAnd all the earth shall hear.\n\nGrace first contrived a way\nTo save rebellious man,\nAnd all the steps that grace display\nWhich drew the wondrous plan.\n\nGrace taught my wand'ring feet\nTo tread the heav'nly road\nAnd new supplies each hour I meet\nWhile pressing on to God.\n\nGrace all the work shall crown\nThrough everlasting days;\nIt lays in heav'n the topmost stone,\nAnd well deserves the praise.",
