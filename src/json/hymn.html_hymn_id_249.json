Raise, O raise\nTo our God the song of praise;\nAll his servants join to sing\nGod our Saviour and our King.\n\nBlessed be for evermore\nThat dread Name which we adore:\nRound the world his praise be sung\nThrough all lands, in every tongue.\n\nO'er all nations God alone,\nHigher than the heav'ns his throne;\nWho is like to God most high,\nInfinite in majesty!\n\nYet to view the heav'ns he bends;\nYea, to earth he condescends;\nPassing by the rich and great,\nFor the low and desolate.\n\nHe can raise the poor to stand\nWith the princes of the land;\nWealth upon the needy shower:\nSet him with the high in power.\n\nHe the broken spirit cheers:\nTurns to joy the mourner's tears;\nSuch the wonders of his ways;\nPraise his name, for ever praise!",
