Thy God reigneth!\"\n\nSinful soul, thy debt is paid;\n\"Thy God reigneth!\"\nOn the Lord thy sins were laid;\n\"Thy God reigneth!\"\nOn the cross of Calvary,\nJesus shed his blood for thee,\nFrom all sin to set thee free:\n\"Thy God reigneth! Thy God reigneth!\"\n\nSeeking soul, to Jesus turn;\n\"Thy God reigneth!\"\nNone that seek him will he spurn;\n\"Thy God reigneth!\"\nWandering sheep the Shepherd seeks,\nAnd when found he ever keeps,\nFor he slumbers not nor sleeps:\n\"Thy God reigneth! Thy God reigneth!\"\n\nJoin, ye saints, the truth proclaim,\n\"Thy God reigneth!\"\nShout it forth with glad acclaim,\n\"Thy God reigneth!\"\nZion, wake! the morn is nigh,\nSee it break from yonder sky;\nLoud and clear the watchmen cry:\n\"Thy God reigneth! Thy God reigneth!\"\n\nChurch of Christ, awake, awake!\n\"Thy God reigneth!\"\nForward, then, fresh courage take:\n\"Thy God reigneth!\"\nSoon, descending from his throne,\nHe shall claim thee for his own;\nSin shall then be overthrown:\n\"Thy God reigneth! Thy God reigneth!\"",
