Is it the crowning day?\nI'll live for today, nor anxious be,\nJesus, my Lord, I soon shall see;\nGlad day! Glad day! Is it the crowning day?\n\nI may go home today,\nGlad day! Glad day!\nSeemeth I hear their song;\nHail to the radiant throng!\nIf I should go home today.\n\nWhy should I anxious be?\nGlad day! Glad day!\nLights appear on the shore,\nStorms will affright nevermore,\nFor he is at hand today.\n\nFaithful I'll be today,\nGlad day! Glad day!\nAnd I will freely tell\nWhy I should love him so well,\nFor he is my all today.",
