I know his Name,\nHis Name is all my trust;\nNor will he put my soul to shame,\nNor let my hope be lost.\n\nFirm as his throne his promise stands,\nAnd he can well secure\nWhat I've committed to his hands\nTill the decisive hour.\n\nThen will he own my worthless name\nBefore his Father's face,\nAnd in the new Jerusalem\nAppoint my soul a place.",
