O how love I thy law!\nIt is my meditation all the day.\nO how love I thy law! O how love I thy law!\nIt is my meditation all the day.\n\nThe precepts of the Lord are right;\nWith joy they fill the heart;\nThe Lord's commandments all are pure,\nAnd clearest light impart.\n\nThe fear of God is undefiled\nAnd ever shall endure;\nThe statutes of the Lord are truth\nAnd righteousness most pure.\n\nThey warn from ways of wickedness\nDispleasing to the Lord,\nAnd in the keeping of his Word\nThere is a great reward.",
