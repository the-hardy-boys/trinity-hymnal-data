Jesus saves!\nBear the news to ev'ry land,\nClimb the steeps and cross the waves,\nOnward! 'tis our Lord's command;\nJesus saves! Jesus saves!\n\nWaft it on the rolling tide:\nJesus saves! Jesus saves!\nTell to sinners far and wide:\nJesus saves! Jesus saves!\nSing, ye islands of the sea;\nEcho back, ye ocean caves;\nEarth shall keep her jubilee:\nJesus saves! Jesus saves!\n\nSing above the battle strife,\nJesus saves! Jesus saves!\nBy his death and endless life,\nJesus saves! Jesus saves!\nSing it softly through the gloom,\nWhen the heart for mercy craves;\nSing in triumph o'er the tomb\nJesus saves! Jesus saves!\n\nGive the winds a mighty voice,\nJesus saves! Jesus saves!\nLet the nations now rejoice\nJesus saves! Jesus saves!\nShout salvation full and free,\nHighest hills and deepest caves;\nThis our song of victory\nJesus saves! Jesus saves!",
