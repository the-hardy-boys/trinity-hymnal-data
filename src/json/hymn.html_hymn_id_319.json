  "lyrics": "I love to tell the story of unseen things above,\nOf Jesus and his glory, of Jesus and his love.\nI love to tell the story, because I know 'tis true;\nIt satisfies my longings as nothing else could do.\n\nI love to tell the story, 'twill be my theme in glory\nTo tell the old, old story of Jesus and his love.\n\nI love to tell the story; more wonderful it seems\nThan all the golden fancies of all our golden dreams.\nI love to tell the story, it did so much for me;\nAnd that is just the reason I tell it now to thee.\n\nI love to tell the story; 'tis pleasant to repeat\nWhat seems, each time I tell it, more wonderfully sweet.\nI love to tell the story, for some have never heard\nThe message of salvation from God's own holy Word.\n\nI love to tell the story; for those who know it best\nSeem hungering and thirsting to hear it, like the rest,\nAnd when, in scenes of glory, I sing the new, new song,\n'Twill be the old, old story, that I have loved so long.",
