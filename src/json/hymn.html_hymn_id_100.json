Father, we thank thee!\nFather in heaven, we thank thee!\n\nFor the fruit upon the tree,\nFor the birds that sing of thee,\nFor the earth in beauty dressed,\nFather, mother, and the rest,\nFor thy precious, loving care,\nFor thy bounty ev'rywhere,\n\nFor the sunshine warm and bright,\nFor the day and for the night,\nFor the lessons of our youthÂ—\nHonor, gratitude and truth,\nFor the love that met us here,\nFor the home and for the cheer,\n\nFor our comrades and our plays,\nAnd our happy holidays,\nFor the joyful work and true\nThat a little child may do,\nFor our lives but just begun,\nFor the great gift of thy Son,",
