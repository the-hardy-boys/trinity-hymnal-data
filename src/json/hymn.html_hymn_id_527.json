The great transaction's done!\nI am my Lord's, and he is mine;\nHe drew me, and I followed on,\nCharmed to confess the voice Divine.\n\nNow rest, my long-divided heart;\nFixed on this blissful center, rest;\nWith ashes who would grudge to part,\nWhen called on angels' bread to feast?\n\nHigh heav'n, that heard the solemn vow,\nThat vow renewed shall daily hear,\nTill in life's latest hour I bow,\nAnd bless in death a bond so dear.",
