Alleluia!\nHearts to heav'n and voices raise;\nSing to God a hymn of gladness,\nSing to God a hymn of praise:\nHe who on the cross a victim\nFor the world's salvation bled.\nJesus Christ, the King of Glory,\nNow is risen from the dead.\n\nChrist is risen, Christ the firstfruits\nOf the holy harvest field,\nWhich will all its full abundance\nAt his second coming yield:\nThen the golden ears of harvest\nWill their heads before him wave,\nRipened by his glorious sunshine\nFrom the furrows of the grave.\n\nAlleluia! Alleluia!\nGlory be to God on high;\nAlleluia to the Saviour,\nWho has won the victory;\nAlleluia to the Spirit,\nFount of love and sanctity;\nAlleluia! Alleluia!\nTo the Triune Majesty.",
