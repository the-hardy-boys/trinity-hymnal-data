Christ is coming!\nCome thou blessed Prince of Peace.\n\nEarth can now but tell the story\nOf thy bitter cross and pain;\nShe shall yet behold thy glory,\nWhen thou comest back to reign:\nChrist is coming! Christ is coming!\nLet each heart repeat the strain.\n\nLong thine exiles have been pining,\nFar from rest, and home, and thee:\nBut, in heav'nly vestures shining,\nThey their loving Lord shall see:\nChrist is coming! Christ is coming!\nHaste the joyous jubilee.\n\nWith that blessed hope before us,\nLet no harp remain unstrung;\nLet the mighty advent chorus\nOnward roll from tongue to tongue:\n\"Christ is coming! Christ is coming!\nCome, Lord Jesus, quickly come!\"",
