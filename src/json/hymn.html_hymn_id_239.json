Great is thy faithfulness!\"\nMorning by morning new mercies I see:\nAll I have needed thy hand hath provided\n\"Great is thy faithfulness,\" Lord unto me!\n\nSummer and winter, and springtime and harvest,\nSun, moon and stars in their courses above,\nJoin with all nature in manifold witness\nTo thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.\n\nPardon for sin and a peace that endureth,\nThine own dear presence to cheer and to guide;\nStrength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,\nBlessings all mine, with ten thousand beside.\n\nThomas O.
