  "lyrics": "Sometimes a light surprises\nThe Christian while he sings;\nIt is the Lord, who rises\nWith healing in his wings:\nWhen comforts are declining,\nHe grants the soul again\nA season of clear shining,\nTo cheer it after rain.\n\nIn holy contemplation\nWe sweetly then pursue\nThe theme of God's salvation,\nAnd find it ever new;\nSet free from present sorrow,\nWe cheerfully can say,\nLet the unknown tomorrow\nBring with it what it may.\n\nIt can bring with it nothing\nBut he will bear us through;\nWho gives the lilies clothing\nWill clothe his people too:\nBeneath the spreading heavens\nNo creature but is fed;\nAnd he who feeds the ravens\nWill give his children bread.\n\nThough vine nor fig tree neither\nTheir wonted fruit shall bear,\nThough all the field should wither,\nNor flocks nor herds be there;\nYet God the same abiding,\nHis praise shall tune my voice,\nFor, while in him confiding,\nI cannot but rejoice.",
