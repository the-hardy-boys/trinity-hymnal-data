Jesus, our blessed Redeemer!\nSing, O earth, his wonderful love proclaim!\nHail him! hail him! highest archangels in glory;\nStrength and honor give to his holy name!\nLike a shepherd, Jesus will guard his children,\nIn his arms he carries them all day long:\n\nPraise him! praise him! tell of his excellent greatness,\nPraise him! praise him! ever in joyful song!\n\nPraise him! praise him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer!\nFor our sins he suffered and bled and died;\nHe our Rock, our hope of eternal salvation,\nHail him! hail him! Jesus the crucified.\nSound his praises! Jesus who bore our sorrows,\nLove unbounded, wonderful, deep and strong:\n\nPraise him! praise him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer!\nHeav'nly portals loud with hosannas ring!\nJesus, Saviour, reigneth for ever and ever;\nCrown him! crown him! Prophet and Priest and King!\nChrist is coming! Over the world victorious,\nPower and glory unto the Lord belong:",
