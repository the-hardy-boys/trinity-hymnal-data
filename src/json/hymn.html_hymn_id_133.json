I'm fixed upon it,\nMount of God's unchanging love.\n\nHere I raise my Ebenezer;\nHither by thy help I'm come;\nAnd I hope, by thy good pleasure,\nSafely to arrive at home.\nJesus sought me when a stranger,\nWand'ring from the fold of God:\nHe, to rescue me from danger,\nInterposed his precious blood.\n\nO to grace how great a debtor\nDaily I'm constrained to be;\nLet that grace now, like a fetter,\nBind my wand'ring heart to thee.\nProne to wander, Lord, I feel it,\nProne to leave the God I love;\nHere's my heart, O take and seal it,\nSeal it for thy courts above.",
