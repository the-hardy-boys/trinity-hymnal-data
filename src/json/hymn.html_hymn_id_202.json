I'll enter in\n\nTo praise thee, Lord, who pray'r hast answered,\n\nAnd savedst me from all my sin.\n\n\nThe stone—O Lord, it is thy doing—\n\nThe stone, the builders did despise,\n\nIs made the headstone of the corner,\n\nAnd it is marv'lous in our eyes.\n\nThis is the day, of days most glorious,\n\nThe Lord hath made; we'll joy and sing:\n\nSend now prosperity, we pray thee;\n\nAnd, O our God, salvation bring!",
