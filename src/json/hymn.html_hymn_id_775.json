Thy God reigneth!\"\n\n\nSinful soul, thy debt is paid;\n\n\"Thy God reigneth!\"\n\nOn the Lord thy sins were laid;\n\n\"Thy God reigneth!\"\n\nOn the cross of Calvary,\n\nJesus shed his blood for thee,\n\nFrom all sin to set thee free:\n\n\"Thy God reigneth! Thy God reigneth!\"\n\n\nSeeking soul, to Jesus turn;\n\n\"Thy God reigneth!\"\n\nNone that seek him will he spurn;\n\n\"Thy God reigneth!\"\n\nWandering sheep the Shepherd seeks,\n\nAnd when found he ever keeps,\n\nFor he slumbers not nor sleeps:\n\n\"Thy God reigneth! Thy God reigneth!\"\n\n\nJoin, ye saints, the truth proclaim,\n\n\"Thy God reigneth!\"\n\nShout it forth with glad acclaim,\n\n\"Thy God reigneth!\"\n\nZion, wake! the morn is nigh,\n\nSee it break from yonder sky;\n\nLoud and clear the watchmen cry:\n\n\"Thy God reigneth! Thy God reigneth!\"\n\n\nChurch of Christ, awake, awake!\n\n\"Thy God reigneth!\"\n\nForward, then, fresh courage take:\n\n\"Thy God reigneth!\"\n\nSoon, descending from his throne,\n\nHe shall claim thee for his own;\n\nSin shall then be overthrown:\n\n\"Thy God reigneth! Thy God reigneth!\"",
