Lover of my soul;\nFriends may fail me, foes assail me,\nHe, my Saviour, makes me whole.\n\nHallelujah! what a Saviour!\nHallelujah, what a Friend!\nSaving, helping, keeping, loving,\nHe is with me to the end.\n\nJesus! what a strength in weakness!\nLet me hide myself in him;\nTempted, tried, and sometimes failing,\nHe, my strength, my vict'ry wins.\n\nJesus! what a help in sorrow!\nWhile the billows o'er me roll,\nEven when my heart is breaking,\nHe, my comfort, helps my soul.\n\nJesus! what a guide and keeper!\nWhile the tempest still is high,\nStorms about me, night o'ertakes me,\nHe, my pilot, hears my cry.\n\nJesus! I do now receive him,\nMore than all in him I find,\nHe hath granted me forgiveness,\nI am his, and he is mine.",
