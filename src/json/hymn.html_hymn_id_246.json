Amen.\n\nHallelujah! praise Jehovah\nFor his mighty acts of fame;\nExcellent his might and greatness;\nFitting praises then proclaim.\n\nHallelujah! praise Jehovah\nWith the trumpet's joyful sound,\nPraise with harp and praise with organ,\nLet his glorious praise abound.\n\nHallelujah! Hallelujah!\nAll that breathe, Jehovah praise;\nLet the voices God has given\nJoyful anthems to him raise.",
