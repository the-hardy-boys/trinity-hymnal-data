O wondrous child\nOf the virgin undefiled!\nThough by all the world disowned,\nStill to be in heav'n enthroned.\n\nFrom the Father forth he came\nAnd returneth to the same,\nCaptive leading death and hell,\nHigh the song of triumph swell!\n\nThou, the Father's only Son,\nHast o'er sin the vict'ry won.\nBoundless shall thy kingdom be;\nWhen shall we its glories see?\n\nPraise to God the Father sing,\nPraise to God the Son, our King,\nPraise to God the Spirit be\nEver and eternally.",
