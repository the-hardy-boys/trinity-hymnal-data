King, who ordainest\nGreat winds thy clarions, lightnings thy sword,\nShow forth thy pity on high where thou reignest;\nGive to us peace in our time, O Lord.\n\nGod the Omnipotent! Mighty Avenger,\nWatching invisible, judging unheard,\nSave us in mercy, O save us from danger;\nGive to us peace in our time, O Lord.\n\nGod the All-merciful! Earth hath forsaken\nThy ways of blessedness, slighted thy Word;\nBid not thy wrath in its terrors awaken;\nGive to us peace in our time, O Lord.\n\nGod the All-righteous One! Man hath defied thee;\nYet to eternity standeth thy Word;\nFalsehood and wrong shall not tarry beside thee;\nGive to us peace in our time, O Lord.\n\nGod the All-wise! By the fire of thy chastening,\nEarth shall to freedom and truth be restored;\nThrough the thick darkness thy kingdom is hastening;\nThou wilt give peace in thy time, O Lord.",
