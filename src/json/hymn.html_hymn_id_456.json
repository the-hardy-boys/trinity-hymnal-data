Amen.\n\nLord of every land and nation,\nAncient of eternal days,\nSounded through the wide creation\nBe thy just and lawful praise.\n\nFor the grandeur of thy nature,\nGrand beyond the seraph's thought;\nFor created works of power,\nWorks with skill and kindness wrought.\n\nBut thy rich, thy free redemption,\nDark through brightness all along,\nThought is poor, and poor expression,\nWho dare sing that awful song?\n\nBrightness of the Father's glory,\nShall thy praise unuttered lie?\nFly, my tongue, such guilty silence,\nSing the Lord who came to die:\n\nFrom the highest throne in glory,\nTo the cross of deepest woe,\nAll to ransom guilty captives,\nFlow my praise, for ever flow.",
