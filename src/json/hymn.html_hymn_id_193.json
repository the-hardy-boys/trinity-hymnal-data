O salvation!\nThe joyful sound proclaim,\nTill each remotest nation\nHas learned Messiah's Name.\n\nWaft, waft, ye winds, his story,\nAnd you, ye waters, roll,\nTill like a sea of glory\nIt spreads from pole to pole.\nTill o'er our ransomed nature\nThe Lamb for sinners slain,\nRedeemer, King, Creator,\nIn bliss returns to reign.",
