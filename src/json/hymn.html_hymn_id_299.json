  "lyrics": "Hushed was the evening hymn,\nThe temple courts were dark;\nThe lamp was burning dim\nBefore the sacred ark;\nWhen suddenly a voice divine\nRang through the silence of the shrine.\n\nThe old man, meek and mild,\nThe priest of Israel, slept;\nHis watch the temple child,\nThe little Levite, kept;\nAnd what from Eli's sense was sealed\nThe Lord to Hannah's son revealed.\n\nO give me Samuel's ear,\nThe open ear, O Lord,\nAlive and quick to hear\nEach whisper of thy Word,\nLike him to answer at thy call,\nAnd to obey thee first of all.\n\nO give me Samuel's heart,\nA lowly heart, that waits\nWhere in thy house thou art,\nOr watches at thy gates;\nBy day and night, a heart that still\nMoves at the breathing of thy will.\n\nO give me Samuel's mind,\nA sweet unmurm'ring faith,\nObedient and resigned\nTo thee in life and death,\nThat I may read with childlike eyes\nTruths that are hidden from the wise.",
