None dare lay claim to merit;\nOur works and conduct have no worth.\nGod in his love sent our Redeemer,\nChrist Jesus, to this sinful earth;\nHis death did for our sins atone,\nAnd we are saved by grace alone.\n\nBy grace! O, mark this word of promise\nWhen thou art by thy sins oppressed,\nWhen Satan plagues thy troubled conscience,\nAnd when thy heart is seeking rest.\nWhat reason cannot comprehend\nGod by his grace to thee doth send.\n\nBy grace! This ground of faith is certain;\nSo long as God is true, it stands.\nWhat saints have penned by inspiration,\nWhat in his Word our God commands,\nWhat our whole faith must rest upon,\nIs grace alone, grace in his Son.",
