Alleluia!\nGod appears on earth to reign.\n\nEv'ry eye shall now behold him,\nRobed in dreadful majesty;\nThose who set at naught and sold him,\nPierced, and nailed him to the tree,\nDeeply wailing, deeply wailing,\nShall the true Messiah see.\n\nEv'ry island, sea, and mountain,\nHeav'n and earth, shall flee away;\nAll who hate him must, confounded,\nHear the trump proclaim the day;\nCome to judgment! Come to judgment!\nCome to judgment, come away!\n\nNow Redemption, long expected,\nSee in solemn pomp appear!\nAll his saints, by man rejected,\nNow shall meet him in the air:\nAlleluia! Alleluia!\nSee the day of God appear!\n\nYea, Amen! let all adore thee,\nHigh on thine eternal throne;\nSaviour, take the pow'r and glory,\nClaim the kingdom for thine own:\nO come quickly, O come quickly:\nAlleluia! come, Lord, come.",
