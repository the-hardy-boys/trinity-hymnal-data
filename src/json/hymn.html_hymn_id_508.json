Emmanuel\nShall come to thee, O Israel.\n\nO come, O come, thou Lord of might,\nWho to thy tribes, on Sinai's height,\nIn ancient times didst give the law\nIn cloud and majesty and awe.\n\nO come, thou Rod of Jesse, free\nThine own from Satan's tyranny;\nFrom depths of hell thy people save,\nAnd give them victory o'er the grave.\n\nO come, thou Dayspring from on high\nAnd cheer us by thy drawing nigh;\nDisperse the gloomy clouds of night,\nAnd death's dark shadows put to flight.\n\nO come, thou Key of David, come\nAnd open wide our heav'nly home;\nMake safe the way that leads on high,\nAnd close the path to misery.",
