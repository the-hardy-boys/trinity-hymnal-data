Fear I cannot know;\nAnywhere with Jesus I can safely go;\n\nAnywhere with Jesus I need fear no ill,\nThough temptations gather round my pathway still;\nHe himself was tempted that he might help me;\nAnywhere with Jesus I may victor be.\n\nAnywhere with Jesus I am not alone;\nOther friends may fail me, he is still my own;\nThough his hand may lead me over dreary ways,\nAnywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.\n\nAnywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,\nWhen the dark'ning shadows round about me creep;\nKnowing I shall waken, never more to roam,\nAnywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.",
