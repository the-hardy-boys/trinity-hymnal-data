In my visions and dreams,\n\nIts bright jasper walls I can see;\n\nTill I fancy but thinly the vail intervenes\n\nBetween the fair city and me.\n\n\nThat unchangeable home is for you and for me,\n\nWhere Jesus of Nazareth stands;\n\nThe King of all kingdoms for ever is he,\n\nAnd he holdeth our crowns in his hands.\n\n\nO how sweet it will be in that beautiful land,\n\nSo free from all sorrow and pain,\n\nWith songs on our lips and with harps in our hands,\n\nTo meet one another again.",
