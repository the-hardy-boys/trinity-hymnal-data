O my glorious Priest,\nHear we not thy golden bells?\n\nThou art coming, thou art coming:\nWe shall meet thee on thy way,\nWe shall see thee, we shall know thee,\nWe shall bless thee, we shall show thee\nAll our hearts could never say:\nWhat an anthem that will be,\nRinging out our love to thee,\nPouring out our rapture sweet\nAt thine own all-glorious feet.\n\nO the joy to see thee reigning,\nThee, my own beloved Lord!\nEv'ry tongue thy Name confessing,\nWorship, honor, glory, blessing\nBrought to thee with glad accord;\nThee, my Master and my Friend,\nVindicated and enthroned;\nUnto earth's remotest end\nGlorified, adored, and owned.",
