Take, eat, and live.\nAnd oft the sacred rite renew\nThat brings my saving love to view.\"\n\nThen in his hands the cup he raised,\nAnd God anew he thanked and praised,\nWhile kindness in his bosom glowed,\nAnd from his lips salvation flowed.\n\n\"My blood I thus pour forth,\" he cries,\n\"To cleanse the soul in sin that lies;\nIn this the covenant is sealed,\nAnd heav'n's eternal grace revealed.\"",
