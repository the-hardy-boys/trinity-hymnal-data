Alleluia!\n\nThou wast their Rock, their Fortress, and their Might;\nThou, Lord, their Captain in the well-fought fight;\nThou, in the darkness drear, their one true Light.\nAlleluia! Alleluia!\n\nO may thy soldiers, faithful, true, and bold,\nFight as the saints who nobly fought of old,\nAnd win with them the victor's crown of gold.\nAlleluia! Alleluia!\n\nThe golden evening brightens in the west;\nSoon, soon to faithful warriors comes their rest;\nSweet is the calm of Paradise the blest.\nAlleluia! Alleluia!\n\nBut lo! there breaks a yet more glorious day;\nThe saints triumphant rise in bright array;\nThe King of Glory passes on his way.\nAlleluia! Alleluia!\n\nFrom earth's wide bounds, from ocean's farthest coast,\nThrough gates of pearl streams in the countless host,\nSinging to Father, Son and Holy Ghost,\nAlleluia! Alleluia!",
