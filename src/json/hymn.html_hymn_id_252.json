Amen.\n\nKing of glory, reign for ever,\nThine an everlasting crown;\nNothing from thy love shall sever\nThose whom thou hast made thine own:\nHappy objects of thy grace,\nDestined to behold thy face.\n\nSaviour, hasten thine appearing;\nBring, O bring the glorious day,\nWhen, the awful summons hearing,\nHeav'n and earth shall pass away:\nThen with golden harps we'll sing,\n\"Glory, glory to our King!\"",
