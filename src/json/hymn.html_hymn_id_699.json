Who then shall dare\nResist his will, distrust his care,\nOr murmur at his wise decrees,\nOr doubt his royal promises?\n\nThe Lord is King! Child of the dust,\nThe judge of all the earth is just;\nHoly and true are all his ways:\nLet every creature speak his praise.\n\nAlike pervaded by his eye,\nAll parts of his dominion lie;\nThis world of ours, and worlds unseen,\nAnd thin the boundary between.\n\nOne Lord, one empire, all secures;\nHe reigns, and life and death are yours:\nThrough earth and heaven one song shall ring,\n\"The Lord omnipotent is King!\"",
