Is it the crowning day?\n\nI'll live for today, nor anxious be,\n\nJesus, my Lord, I soon shall see;\n\nGlad day! Glad day! Is it the crowning day?\n\n\nI may go home today,\n\nGlad day! Glad day!\n\nSeemeth I hear their song;\n\nHail to the radiant throng!\n\nIf I should go home today.\n\n\nWhy should I anxious be?\n\nGlad day! Glad day!\n\nLights appear on the shore,\n\nStorms will affright nevermore,\n\nFor he is at hand today.\n\n\nFaithful I'll be today,\n\nGlad day! Glad day!\n\nAnd I will freely tell\n\nWhy I should love him so well,\n\nFor he is my all today.",
