Peace, be still!\"\n\nThey all shall sweetly obey thy will—\n\n\"Peace, peace, be still!\"\n\n\nMaster, with anguish in spirit\n\nI bow in my grief today;\n\nThe depths of my sad heart are troubled,\n\nO waken and save, I pray;\n\nTorrents of sin and of anguish\n\nSweep o'er my sinking soul!\n\nAnd I perish! I perish! dear Master;\n\nO hasten, and take control!\n\n\nMaster, the terror is over,\n\nThe elements sweetly rest;\n\nEarth's sun in the calm lake is mirrored,\n\nAnd heaven's within my breast.\n\nLinger, O blessed Redeemer,\n\nLeave me alone no more;\n\nAnd with joy I shall make the blest harbor,\n\nAnd rest on the blissful shore.",
