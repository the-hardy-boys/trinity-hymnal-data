God is here, whom day and night\nUnited choirs of angels praise;\nTo him, enthron'd above all height,\nThe host of heav'n their anthems raise.\n\nAlmighty Father, may our praise\nThy courts with grateful fragrance fill;\nStill may we stand before thy face,\nStill hear and do thy sovereign will.\n\nTo Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,\nThe God whom earth and heav'n adore,\nFrom men and from the angel host\nBe praise and glory evermore.",
