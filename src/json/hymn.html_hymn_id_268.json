'Tis thee we seek.\n\nCome, Holy Comforter, Presence Divine,\nNow in our longing hearts graciously shine;\nO for thy mighty pow'r! O for a blessed show'r,\nFilling this hallowed hour with joy divine!\n\nSaviour, thy work revive: here may we see\nThose who are dead in sin quickened by thee;\nCome to our hearts tonight, make ev'ry burden light;\nCheer thou our waiting sight; we long for thee.",
