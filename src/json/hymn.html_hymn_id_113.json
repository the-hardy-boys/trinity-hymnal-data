Alleluia!\n\nLives again our glorious King; Alleluia!\nWhere, O death, is now thy sting? Alleluia!\nOnce he died, our souls to save; Alleluia!\nWhere thy victory, O grave? Alleluia!\n\nSoar we now where Christ has led, Alleluia!\nFollowing our exalted Head; Alleluia!\nMade like him, like him we rise: Alleluia!\nOurs the cross, the grave, the skies. Alleluia!\n\nHail, the Lord of earth and heav'n! Alleluia!\nPraise to thee by both be giv'n; Alleluia!\nThee we greet triumphant now; Alleluia!\nHail, the Resurrection Thou! Alleluia!",
