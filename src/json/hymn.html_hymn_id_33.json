Alleluia!\n\nThe strife is o'er, the battle done;\nThe victory of life is won;\nThe song of triumph has begun.\nAlleluia!\n\nThe pow'rs of death have done their worst,\nBut Christ their legions hath dispersed:\nLet shouts of holy joy outburst.\nAlleluia!\n\nThe three sad days have quickly sped;\nHe rises glorious from the dead:\nAll glory to our risen head!\nAlleluia!\n\nHe closed the yawning gates of hell;\nThe bars from heav'n's high portals fell:\nLet hymns of praise his triumphs tell.\nAlleluia!\n\nLord, by the stripes which wounded thee,\nFrom death's dread sting thy servants free,\nThat we may live and sing to thee,\nAlleluia!",
