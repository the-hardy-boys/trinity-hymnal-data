'tis the Shepherd's voice I hear,\n\nOut in the desert dark and drear,\n\nCalling the sheep who've gone astray\n\nFar from the Shepherd's fold away.\n\n\nBring them in, bring them in,\n\nBring them in, from the fields of sin;\n\nBring them in, bring them in,\n\nBring the wandering ones to Jesus.\n\n\nWho'll go and help this Shepherd kind,\n\nHelp him the wand'ring ones to find?\n\nWho'll bring the lost ones to the fold,\n\nWhere they'll be sheltered from the cold?\n\n\nOut in the desert hear their cry,\n\nOut on the mountains wild and high;\n\nHark! 'tis the Master speaks to thee,\n\n\"Go find my sheep where'er they be.\"",
